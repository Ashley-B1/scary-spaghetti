                        </div>
                        <div class="story">
                            <p>Today was St. Juniper’s Annual Witch Hunt. An event where all the townspeople gather in town square and hunt the “witch”. My family nominated me as this year’s witch. I can’t believe I allowed my mom to force this stupid costume on me. “C’mon Mary Lee, you will be the cutest little witch in the county.”, she rambled non-stop until I caved in.</p>
                            <p>My friends all laughed when I told them I would be the town witch this year. I insisted it was all my mom’s fault, but they could care less. Connor was the most excited of the group because of the prize. Ya see, whoever catches the witch will receive a grand prize of a $200 gift card. He begged me to rat out my location and I could get half of the reward. I was still on the fence on doing it since I get diddly squat for being the witch.</p>

                        <div class="story">
                            <p>It was April 16th, 1767 in Sulphur Springs, Texas. There was a beautiful woman named Eliza who was one of Harold Pride’s house slaves. She had a beautiful golden-brown complexion and big bright hazel eyes. Harold on the other hand, was a rotted being. He abused his slaves and constantly assaulted Eliza. </p>
                            <p>One day, in a drunken stupor he decided to force Eliza into his room to “clean”. When Eliza started cleaning the room Harold undid his pants and ordered her to get on the bed. Eliza refused her master’s request and tried to run out the room before he had his way with her. He grabbed her by the arm and threw the petite woman across the room. She hit her head at the edge of his dresser and was dazed.</p>

                        <div class="story">
                            <p>It was a quiet day at the SCP Site 81. It’s been about 2 months since the last containment breach, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. Dr. Nicole Hardmon was assigned to the newly discovered SCP-8917. She was given no summary or hint as to what it was and was told to just “observe and take notes”. She swiped her B class access card to SCP-8917’s door and entered the room with 2 C class personnel for security measure.</p>
                            <p>They entered the room to find a small creature, no more than 2 feet tall and covered in lavender colored fur. It had 8 spider-like eyes and no mouth. It sat quietly in the far left-side corner of its containment room. Dr. Hardmon and her team exchanged confused looks with each other before getting closer to the creature. Dr. Hardmon got out her clipboard and started writing notes and asked, “Can you understand me?” The creature nodded their head to say yes. “Alright, let’s start this interview.” She responded.</p>
